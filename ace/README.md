The Python scripts stored here are shown during the lecture and exercise on [Advanced Communications Engineering](https://www.cel.kit.edu/lehre_2591.php) at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The corresponding slides can be found in the [ILIAS course for the lecture](https://ilias.studium.kit.edu/goto.php/crs/2748140).

Dependencies
--------------
- python >= 3.10
- jupyter notebook
- numpy/scipy
- matplotlib
- Matlab and Simulink >=2015b

Usage
----------
The programming language used, Python, is pre-installed on common Linux distributions and OSX. However, we recommend students to use [`miniconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main), which is a minimal package manager free for use for educational purposes.

Matlab and Simulink can be obtained free of charge by KIT students from the KIT software shop.
