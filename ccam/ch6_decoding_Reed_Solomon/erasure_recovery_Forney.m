%% construct GF(2^4) using primitive polynomial Z^4 + Z^3 + 1
% primitive element alpha
alpha = gf(2,4,'D^4+D^3+1');

m = alpha.m;
q = 2^m;

% array with all q elements of the Galois field
gf_elements = gf(0:(q-1), 4, alpha.prim_poly);




% correctable erasures of the RS code
t = 6;



% Construct primitive GRS code (i.e., q = n-1)
n = q-1;
k = n - t;  % k is immediately given as the GRS code is MDS (k = n-d+1 and d = t+1)

% use all q-1 disting elements of GF(q) as code locators
gamma = alpha.^[0:(n-1)];


% use random column multipliers
v = alpha.^[randi(n,1,n)-1];


% construct parity-check matrix of the code
H = [];
for j = [0:(n-k-1)]
    H = [H; gamma.^j];
end
H = H * diag(v);




% column multipliers of the dual code are given by gamma/v, as our GRS code
% is primitive
v_prime = gamma ./ v;

% construct generator matrix (parity-check matrix of the dual code)
G = [];
for j = [0:(k-1)]
    G = [G; gamma.^j];
end
G = G * diag(v_prime);


% check if G*H' is actually zero
if any(G*H' ~= 0)
    error('Something went wrong during code construction');
end

%% encode a randomly generated codeword
u = gf_elements(randi(q,1,k));

% encode
x = u*G;

% generate erasures patterns
% number of erasures
E = 6;
if E > t
    warning('number of errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the code');
end

% set of erased positions
E = randperm(n,E);

% generate received codeword
y = x;

% erase positions (set to zero in received codeword)
y(E) = gf(0, m, alpha.prim_poly);



%% carry out decoding
% First step: compute syndrome
S = y * H';

if all(S==0)
    fprintf('No erasures, detected, filling erased positions with zeros');    
    return;
end


% construct error locator polynomial, which is known from the erased
% positions
Lambda_poly = gf(1, m, alpha.prim_poly);

for j = 1:numel(E)
    Lambda_poly = conv(Lambda_poly, [gamma(E(j)), 1]);
end



% find error values using Forney's method
% first, compute the error evaluator polynomial
Tm = gf(zeros(numel(E), numel(E)+1), m, alpha.prim_poly);
for j=1:numel(E)
    Tm(j, j:-1:1) = S(1:j);
end
Omega = Tm*fliplr(Lambda_poly)';

% generate polynomial
Omega_poly = fliplr(Omega');

% compute error values using Forney's algorithm
% calculate the derivative of the error locator polynomial. Attention must
% be paid that the multiplication with the exponent is actually carried out
% as additions in the Galois field
derLambda_poly = Lambda_poly(1:end-1) .* mod([(prod(size(Lambda_poly))-1):-1:1],2);

% carry out corrections directly in the received codeword y
for j=1:numel(E)
    y(E(j)) = - gamma(E(j)) * polyval(Omega_poly, 1/gamma(E(j))) / polyval(derLambda_poly, 1/gamma(E(j))) / v(E(j));
end

if all(y == x)
    fprintf('Erasure recovery using Forney''s algorithm successful!\n');
