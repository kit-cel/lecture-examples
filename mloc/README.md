Example scripts for "Machine Learning and Optimization in Communications" lecture
=================================================================================

This repository contains examples and simulations used in the lecture [Machine Learning and Optimization in Communications](http://www.cel.kit.edu/lehre_1669.php) of the faculty for electrical engineering and information technology (ETIT) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The corresponding slides and lecture notes can be found in ILIAS (only available for enrolled students).


Python Dependencies
---------------------
- python >= 3.5
- jupyter notebook
- numpy/scipy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- tensorflow


Usage of Python Notebooks
-------------------------
The programming language [Python](http://www.python.org) is usually pre-installed in current Linux distributions and OSX. Additionally required modules need to be installed by hand from the packet sources. Alternatively, we highly recommend to use readily available Python distributions that are tuned for data science. One such distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda is also the preferred method to install a complete Python environment on a Windows machine. If you are using Anaconda, we advise you to create an environment within you run the notebooks. You can directly create the environment for running the notebooks using the provided environment.yml file using `conda env create -f environment.yml`. You can then activate the envinronment using `conda activate lecture_MLOC`.


Passive Viewing of the Notebooks using Pre-Generated, Static Content
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Please try [Jupyter notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KIT-CEL/lecture-examples/tree/master/mloc/).
